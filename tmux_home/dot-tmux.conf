# Special keys are handled by terminals by sending ESC followed by some other

# the rest of the sequence so that it can send the actual key.
# The default is 500 but that means that after pressing ESC in vim, it takes
# half a second before vim gets the ESC to get out of insert mode.  Way too long!
# However, if I set it to 1(ms), then when I start TMUX and when I reattach, I
# get these keys sent to my active pane: `61;6;7;22;23;24;28;32;42c`.  So the
# idea is to set it as low as possible so that presing ESC in vim isn't
# annoying high enough that TMUX has time to receive the part after ESC in
# escape sequences.
