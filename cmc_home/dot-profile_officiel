# From 2022-04-01
# Uses ldpreload to compensate for the slowness that can be caused by
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH being pretty big.
#
# From JP:
#
#    Following HPCO's announcement below of the release of new site and
#    community profiles, RPN has released a new 1.17 profile containing these
#    updates. Note also that this profile adds libc.so.6 in the LD_PRELOAD
#    variable on U2 in order to speed up the launching of shell commands and to
#    limit the impact of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
