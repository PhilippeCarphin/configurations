# Regular setup is that HOME=/home/$USER which is a link to where your home
# really is but this causes some annoying little things:
# - #{pane_current_path} in TMUX is always the physical path so when we create
#   a new pane with `split-window "#{pane_current_path}"`, PWD in the new shell
#   is different from in the pane that we split from.  Without this, starting
#   in `~/Documents (/home/$USER/Documents)` and splitting gives a new pane in
#   `/some/path/x/y/abcd/efgh/$USER/Documents` which is annoying.
#   This trick is mainly so that I can see a tilde instead of that long prefix.
# - With VSCode debugger, when it opens files for you, it won't notice that
#   the file is already open because the open file is `/home/$USER/.../file.c`
#   but the file where the debugger stopped is `/some/path/x/y/abcd/$USER/.../file.c`
#   so you get the file opened in two tabs which is also annoying.

# PROBLEM: If you have 'set colored-stats on' in your ~/.inputrc, readline will
# color completion candidates according to LS_COLORS.  Therefore it will color
# anything that is not a file (program options) according to the as 'missing
# files' which if you have 'mi=01;05;37;49' in your LS_COLORS is bold blinking
# bright white on red background which is super annoying.

# SOLUTION: Since readline parses LS_COLORS at initialization and never again
# after that, the trick is to set 'mi=00' in LS_COLORS, then do anything that
# causes readline to be initialized, and then set LS_COLORS back to its
# original value.  Alternatively we could just not put anything for missing
# files in LS_COLORS but I wanted figure out a way to have some coloring for
# missing files
#
# RELEVANT CODE FROM READLINE
# In http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/lib/readline/:
# - In parse_colors.c:300 Function _rl_parse_colors() parses LS_COLORS
# - In readline.c:1322 Function readline_initialize_everything calls
#   _rl_parse_colors();
# - In readline.c:1183 Function rl_initialize() calls readline_initialize_everything()
#   only if rl_initialized == 0 then sets rl_initialized to 1 so that it
#   is never called again and does "other stuff".  Future calls to
#   rl_initialize() only do the "other stuff"
# - In realine.c:354 Function readline(), rl_initialize() is called everytime
#   but after the first time, it only does the "other stuff".
#
# IMPORTANT: This needs to be done before anything else causes the
# initialization of readline otherwise the initialization will already have
# happened with whatever LS_COLORS was at that time.  For example, fzf
# initialization does many 'bind x y' commands which initializes readline
