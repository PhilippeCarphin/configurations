# PROBLEM: If you have 'set colored-stats on' in your ~/.inputrc, readline will
# color completion candidates according to LS_COLORS.  Therefore it will color
# anything that is not a file (program options) according to the as 'missing
# files' which if you have 'mi=01;05;37;49' in your LS_COLORS is bold blinking
# bright white on red background which is super annoying.

# SOLUTION: Since readline parses LS_COLORS at initialization and never again
# after that, the trick is to set 'mi=00' in LS_COLORS, then do anything that
# causes readline to be initialized, and then set LS_COLORS back to its
# original value.  Alternatively we could just not put anything for missing
# files in LS_COLORS but I wanted figure out a way to have some coloring for
# missing files
#
# RELEVANT CODE FROM READLINE
# In http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/lib/readline/:
# - In parse_colors.c:300 Function _rl_parse_colors() parses LS_COLORS
# - In readline.c:1322 Function readline_initialize_everything calls
#   _rl_parse_colors();
# - In readline.c:1183 Function rl_initialize() calls readline_initialize_everything()
#   only if rl_initialized == 0 then sets rl_initialized to 1 so that it
#   is never called again and does "other stuff".  Future calls to
#   rl_initialize() only do the "other stuff"
# - In realine.c:354 Function readline(), rl_initialize() is called everytime
#   but after the first time, it only does the "other stuff".
#
# IMPORTANT: This needs to be done before anything else causes the otherwise
# the initialization will already have happened with whatever LS_COLORS was at
# that time.  For example, fzf initialization does many 'bind x y' commands
# which initializes readline

    # # Put back the 'mi' part in LS_COLORS
    # # We need the 'show-colored-stats' to be for BASH only in ~/.inputrc since
    # # the python interpreter will initialize readline in its process and will
    # # read LS_COLORS.  Anyway, we don't want show-colored-stats in Python so
