# From Philipe Blain

# color folder/files during completion
# This setting is deactivated because completion candidates for non-file items
# are colored as if they were broken links which for me is flashing red
# set colored-stats on

# color common prefix during completion
set colored-completion-prefix on

# add type suffix to items during autocompletion
set visible-stats on
